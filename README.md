# Bug Bounty Program

Take part in our bounty program and help GoCryptobot become a killer blockchain game. 

[GoCryptobot](http://gocryptobot.io/) is an Ethereum-based mobile game fully playable on mobile. You can have 100% ownership of the in-game characters, upgrade them on run mode, trade them at the in-game exchange, and even have them battle on PvP mode. Join GoCryptobot, a fun and rewarding game that allows transparent and safe transactions among players. All this is possible on your mobile.

In order to keep our smart contracts safe from security vulnerabilities, we have decided to split our bug bounty program into two phases. The first bug bounty program aims to find vulnerabilities in our in-game currency (ERC20) and in our game items (ERC721), whereas the second one aims to find issues in the smart contracts used in PvP mode and at the ERC20 exchange. You can join either or both of them by only sending us a pull request on Github. 

## Bug Bounty Program 1

- Period:  March 10~16th, 2018 (it closes at 23:59pm KST)

- Smart contract 1: ERC20

GCC (ERC20) is an in-game currency used in GoCryptobot

- Smart contract 2: ERC721

GoCryptobot is a story about AI-installed robots that run from their exploiter humans in search for their creator, Doctor Z. The robots are composed of 4 parts: head, body, legs and buster which are upgraded throughout the game. Each part of the robot is a non-fungible token that complies with the ERC 721 specification. This means that the player has 100% ownership of the parts, trade and exchange them with other people even outside the game. At Kodebox, we are also developing a follow-up game where the player has the choice of using the same robots that he/she is using in GoCryptobot. 

### Bug Classification

Bugs are classified into 3 levels: P1 (high), P2 (medium) and P3 (low)

- P1 (high):  a security vulnerability that will result in loss of value
  
  e.g. Steal ERC20/721 tokens from someone, mint tokens at your discretion

- P2 (medium): a security vulnerability that will not result in loss of value but can result in a showstopper of the game

  e.g. Block actions for all users

- P3 (low):  a security vulnerability that will not result in loss of value but can cause great inconvenience for some fraction of users

  e.g. Block a user from transferring tokens

### Bug Report Process

Send us a [pull request on our Github repository](https://github.com/gocryptobot/contracts-bounty/pulls).
We trust you are a decent developer with common sense, so actions such as reporting issues already reported by others, issues that are out of scope, abusive behavior, personal attacks, etc will be completely ignored. Please, be reminded that we will review the issues and assess if they fall into the bugs classification at our own discretion. 

Every contributor that has reported a bug that can be classified as P1, P2 and P3 issues will be rewarded. Please, use Github accounts that you own and use, so that we can contact you when we need your wallet address for sending the compensations.

- P1 (high): 1 ETH 
- P2 (medium): 0.5 ETH 
- P3 (low): 0.3 ETH
